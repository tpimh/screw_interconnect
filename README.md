# Screw Interconnect

Requirements: OpenSCAD, [fasteners library](https://github.com/txoof/OpenSCAD_fasteners/blob/master/nuts_and_bolts.scad), [fingerjoint library](https://github.com/txoof/fingerjoint/blob/master/fingerjoint.scad).

This model is currently using laser-cut parts, 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf parts.

To build a custom box you would need rigid laser-cuttable sheet material, 8 3D-printed corners, 4 M2 hex-pillars, 16 M2 hex-nuts and 24 M2 countersunk screws.
